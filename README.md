# Customers-Churn-Analysis

Client: 

A financial institution aiming to reduce customer churn by analyzing key factors driving customer exits.

Objective:

The goal of this project was to analyze customer data to determine the primary reasons for customer churn, including factors such as demographics, credit ratings, engagement levels, and more. By identifying key risk factors, the bank aimed to develop targeted strategies to retain customers and reduce churn rates, particularly among high-risk segments.

Key Insights:

- 10K total customers, with 5,151 active customers and 4,849 inactive customers.
- 7,963 customers were retained, while 2,037 exited.
  

  
Churn by Credit Type:

- Customers with Fair (685 exits) and Poor (520 exits) credit ratings had the highest churn rates.
- Excellent credit rating holders had the lowest churn, with only 128 exits.


  
Churn by Geography:

- Germany had the highest churn rate at 0.32%, followed by Spain at 0.17% and France at 0.16%
  

  
Churn by Gender:

- Female customers accounted for 55.92% of exits, while Male customers accounted for 44.08%.
Churn by Age Group:
- The 40-49 age group had the highest number of exits, particularly among credit card holders.
Churn by Tenure:
- Customers with shorter tenures (3-7 years) had higher churn rates, indicating early disengagement.
Churn by Number of Products:
- Customers with only 1 product were more likely to exit, especially those who were inactive. This suggests that product engagement correlates with retention.


  
Churn by Salary:

- Customers earning less than 20K had the highest exits, with female exits being consistently higher across all salary ranges.
Primary Reasons for Churn:
- The leading reasons for churn were low product engagement (1,409 exits) and inactivity (1,183 exits).



Business Outcomes:
Retention Strategies:

- Focus on retaining customers aged 40-49, particularly credit card holders, by offering special promotions and programs.
Improve customer experience in the first and second years to reduce early exits.


Engagement Improvement:

- Encourage customers to adopt multiple products through cross-selling and bundling strategies, reducing churn from low product usage.
Geographical Focus:
- Implement specific retention strategies in regions with higher churn rates, particularly Germany, to address local challenges.

  
Targeted Campaigns:

- Launch campaigns to re-engage the 4,849 inactive customers.
- Focus on high-income female customers to prevent further exits.

  
Conclusion:

By analyzing customer churn and identifying key risk factors, the bank was able to develop targeted retention strategies that improved customer satisfaction and reduced churn rates. This analysis provided a clear roadmap for improving customer engagement and driving long-term loyalty.
